This project will produce an interactive visualisation aimed at exploring and uncovering the invasiveness of bulk tracking practices currently deployed on the most popular websites of the Internet.

The initial proof of concept is based on [Glow Rope](https://palebluepixel.org/2016/07/13/visualizing-network-traffic-with-webgl/).

### Iteration #1

 - Canvas used instead of WebGL
 - Draw a dynamic grid on canvas
 - Plot points and draw a circle around them
 - When point moves from A to B, it follows the semi-circle (**to-do**)
 - Animate the travelling path (**to-do**)
